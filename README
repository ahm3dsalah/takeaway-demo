
 - there are 2 players on this game. both spring boot app taking to each other over rest api
 - easy deployment since only one jar is generated from each player
 - player 1 will start the game once the server is running and it will display a message if the other player is offline
 - player one can be configured using configure endpoint by setting the initial score and it will send it to the second player, also it can be configured by
   setting custom score by adding command line parmas --game.initialScore=<intial score> and it will start automaticly with this score 
   
 - both players are single jar file so can be easly run on any environment

## how to start
1. java - jar on player 2 generated jar
2. java - jar on player 1 generated jar
3. start player 2 first
4. player one will start the game directly once server started

I also added docker support so they cun run easily on any machine with docker like servers here is the commands to start it
 1- open terminal and run the below commands
 2- docker run --name takeaway-player2 ahm3dsalah/player2
 3- docker run --name takeaway-player1 ahm3dsalah/player1
