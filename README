
 - there are 2 players on this game. both spring boot app taking to each other over rest api
 - easy deployment since only one jar is generated from each player
 - player 1 will start the game once the server is running and it will display a message if the other player is offline
 - player one can be configured using configure endpoint by setting the initial score and it will send it to the second player, also it can be configured by
   setting custom score by adding command line parmas --game.initialScore=<intial score> and it will start automaticly with this score 
   
 - both players are single jar file so can be easly run on any environment

## how to start
1. java - jar on player 2 generated jar
2. java - jar on player 1 generated jar
3. start player 2 first
4. player one will start the game directly once server started

I tried to add docker support so it can easly be deployed , but I needed bi-directional linking since the two containers needs
to talk to each other . I can make more invistigation to it

- you can find the docker files and every thing is ready to use docker
- I used system outs to console only to make output more visible instead of logging
